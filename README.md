# PacMan-Pygame
The traditional Pacman game created using pygame library of python.

This project was the result of me learning python and specifically the pygame module. 

Here, I try to replicate the world famous pacman game using the pygame module.

Pacman game consists of a player and 4 ghosts that try to catch the player. The player must eat all the food(white dots) within the 3 lives to win the game. Player can be moved with the four arrow keys.

The code is inspired from: youtube/@lemastertech
